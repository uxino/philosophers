# Philosophers Project

The Philosophers project is focused on the classic philosophers problem. Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of how threads operate and how to manage concurrency. It provided valuable insights into synchronization techniques and the challenges of avoiding deadlock and race conditions in multithreaded environments.
